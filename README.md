## Info
I did NOT make this, go support the original author and their work [here](https://github.com/lezzthanthree/config-files). I just add some extra scripts, and haven't tested even.

My friend wanted to have this, and I was sick of doing things manually, that's why this exists.

I'm a lazy person. I didn't modify anything, nor made meaningful changes, so if you want to improve the looks of this thing, **please get to the original author**, they will help you. If you want to fix the script, you're way more than welcome to do so.

**tl;dr** don't use this. It's unusable for the time being.
